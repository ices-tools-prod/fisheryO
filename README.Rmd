# fisheryO

The fisheryO package is offered to provide documentation of the processes used to download, aggregate, and analyze data for ICES Fisheries Overviews. Further, the package contains R functions to facilitate the standard plotting of these data.

In 2017, ICES will provide Fisheries Overviews for the following ecoregions:

* [Fisheries Overview of Baltic Sea Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/BalticSea/Draft_advice/BalticSeaEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview including mixed fisheries considerations of Celtic Seas Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/CelticSea/Draft_advice/CelticSeasEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview including mixed fisheries considerations of Greater North Sea Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/NorthSea/Draft_advice/GreaterNorthSeaEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview of Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea Ecoregions](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/BarentsSea/Draft_advice/NorwegianSeaBarentsSeaEcoregions_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)


Ultimately, the following Fisheries Overviews will also be produced:

* [Fisheries Overview of Azores Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Widely/Draft_advice/AzoresEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries overviews of Oceanic north-east Atlantic Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Widely/Draft_advice/OceanicNortheastAtlanticEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview including mixed fisheries considerations of Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Biscay/Draft_advice/BayofBiscayandtheIberianCoastEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview of Faroes Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Faroes/Draft_advice/FaroesEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview of Icelandic Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Iceland/Draft_advice/IcelandicEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)
* [Fisheries Overview of Greenland Sea Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2016/Iceland/Draft_advice/GreenlandSeaEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.docx?Web=1)

## Installation

You can install fisheryO from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("slarge/fisheryO")
```


## Work flow

1. As the fisheryO package is compiled, fisheryO downloads source data from ICES web services and databases and saves the raw data as .rdata files in the /data folder. This serves to create a final version of the data used to create each Fisheries Overview document, thatis, a github commit hash could be used as the "Greater North Sea ecoregion" final data reference. The raw data are available as a "promise" and can be explored using the `data()` function. The nuts and bolts of these download steps can be found in the load_raw_data.R file in the /data-raw folder (unless I decide it's better to export all these as functions).

2. Raw data is aggregated and saved as intermediary data files in the /data folder. The nuts and bolts of these data aggregation steps can be found in the clean_raw_data.R file in the /analysis folder (unless I decide it's better to export all these as functions).

3. Plot functions use these intermediary data files to create the standard Fisheries Overviews plots.

The list of data can be found using:
```{r example}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(data(package = "fisheryO")$results[,c("Item", "Title")]),
             caption = c("Raw and intermediate data used to generate Fisheries Overviews"))
```

note: [Consistent naming](https://github.com/slarge/fisheryO/issues/11) will make the data easily searchable using `grep()`.

If you want more information about the data source for each data file, use the "?<data_name>" notation, e.g., `?sag_complete_summary` function to explore the description.

## Plots

```{r kobe_example, echo = TRUE}

fisheryO::plot_kobe("Greater North Sea Ecoregion", guild = "demersal", return_plot = TRUE, dynamic = FALSE)
```

Some of the more complex plots have the option to be dynamic .html graphics with the "dynamic = TRUE" argument.

[To do](https://github.com/slarge/fisheryO/issues/12): If you want more information about the data source used for each plot, use the "?<plot_function>" notation, e.g., `?plot_kobe` function to explore the description.
