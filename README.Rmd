# fisheryO

The fisheryO package is offered to provide documentation of the processes used to download, aggregate, and analyze data for ICES Fisheries Overviews. Further, the package contains R functions to facilitate the standard plotting of these data. ICES data are available to use according to the [ICES Data policy](http://ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/ICES-Data-policy.pdf).

ICES Fisheries Overviews are available for the following ecoregions:

* [Fisheries Overview of Baltic Sea Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/BalticSea/Released_advice/BalticSeaEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.pdf?Web=1) (fisheryO v0.2)
* [Fisheries Overview of the Greater North Sea Ecoregion](https://community.ices.dk/Advice/Advice2017/NorthSea/Released_advice/GreaterNorthSeaEcoregion_FisheriesOverviews.pdf?Web=1)  (fisheryO v0.2)

## Installation

You can install the most recent fisheryO build from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ices-tools-prod/fisheryO")
# library(fisheryO)
```

You can also install the raw data and code used for specific Fisheries Overviews with a "version" tag:

```{r gh-vinstallation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ices-tools-prod/fisheryO", rev = "v0.2")
# library(fisheryO)
```


## Work flow

1. Before the package is built, fisheryO downloads source data from ICES web services and databases and saves the raw data as .rdata files in the /data folder. This serves to create a final version of the data used to create each Fisheries Overview document, thatis, a github commit hash could be used as the "Greater North Sea ecoregion" final data reference. The raw data are available as a "promise" and can be explored extracted using the `data()` function. The nuts and bolts of these download steps can be found in the load_raw_data.R file in the /data-raw folder and links to the raw data can be found in the description files.

2. Raw data processing is dependent on how the data will ultimately be displayed (e.g., figure or table) and several functions modify the raw data. These functions can be viewed in the clean_raw_data.R file in the /R folder to see the assumptions and data wrangling steps to move from raw data to figures and tables.

3. Data aggregating functions are called from within the standard plotting functions, but can be run independently to explore the intermediate data.

The list of data can be found using:
```{r example}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(data(package = "fisheryO")$results[,c("Item", "Title")]))
```

If you want more information about the data source for each data file, use the "?<data_name>" notation, e.g., `?ices_catch_historical_raw` function to explore the description and to find a url for the source.

## Plots

Some of the more complex plots have the option to be dynamic .html graphics with the `dynamic = TRUE` argument.

If you want more information about the data source used for each plot, use the "?<plot_function>" notation, e.g., `?plot_kobe` function to explore the description.



```{r map_example, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "ICES Ecoregions are not quite the same as the ICES areas that most assessments are based on. In fact, much of the historic catch data (`?ices_catch_historical_raw`) is aggregated across multiple ICES areas that are may extend into other ecoregions. The following function will show the discrepancies between the ICES Ecoregions and ICES areas."}

area_definition_map("Baltic Sea Ecoregion",
                    data_caption = FALSE,
                    return_plot = TRUE,
                    save_plot = FALSE)
```


```{r fig2_example, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Baltic Sea finfish landings (thousand tonnes) by (current) country from ICES Official Catch Statistics (Official Historical Catches 1950-2005 and Official Nominal Commercial Catches 2006-2015). The top 10 countries with the greatest aggregate catch are displayed separately and the remaining countries are aggregated and displayed as “other”. "}

ices_catch_plot("Baltic Sea Ecoregion",
                data_caption = FALSE,
                type = "COUNTRY",
                line_count = 9,
                plot_type = "area",
                save_plot = FALSE,
                return_plot = TRUE,
                text.size = 9)
```


```{r fig3_example, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Baltic Sea fishing effort (1000 kW days at sea) by country. There is uncertainty about the effort data available for Finland and Estonia, so fishing effort for these two countries have been omitted from the figure."}

stecf_plot("Baltic Sea Ecoregion",
           data_caption = FALSE,
           metric = "EFFORT",
           type = "COUNTRY",
           line_count = 6,
           plot_type = "line",
           save_plot = FALSE,
           return_plot = TRUE,
           text.size = 9)
```

For plots using ICES Stock Assessment data, the `active_year` argument can be used to choose the assessment year. Baltic Sea advice for 2017 is already published, so we can use the most recent data.

```{r fig7_example, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Left panel (a): Discard rates as a percentage (%) of the total Baltic Sea catch of benthic, demersal and pelagic species (for all years for which ICES has data). Right panel (b): Landings (green) and discards (orange) in weights (1000 tonnes) of the most recent year, 2016"}
guild_discards_fun("Baltic Sea Ecoregion",
                   data_caption = TRUE,
                   active_year = 2017,
                   save_plot = FALSE,
                   return_plot = TRUE)
```


Some stocks are fished right at F<sub>MSY</sub> and the number of decimal places can determine the status (e.g., good or bad). `calculate_status = TRUE` calculates the ratio of stock status relative to reference points and might result in a slightly different status than what is found in published advice. From 2017, ICES Stock Assessment Graphs database archives the stock status for each stock as a factor level (e.g., red, green, grey, orange... etc), includes qualitative and "proxy" reference points and `calculate_status = FALSE` should be used.

```{r fig10_example, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "Status summary of Baltic Sea stocks in 2017 relative to the ICES Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) approach and precautionary approach (PA) (excluding salmon and sea-trout). Grey represents unknown reference points. For MSY: green represents a stock that is fished below F<sub>MSY</sub> or the stock size is greater than MSY B<sub>trigger</sub>; red represents a stock status that is fished above FMSY or the stock size is lower than MSY Btrigger. For PA: green represents a stock that is fished below Fpa or the stock size is greater than Bpa; orange represents a stock that is fished between Fpa and Flim or the stock size is between Blim and Bpa; red represents a stock that is fished above Flim or the stock size is less than Blim. Stocks having a fishing mortality below or at Fpa and a stock size above Bpa are defined as being inside safe biological limits. F is in the table denoting the fishing pressure and SSB is in the table denoting the stock size. A detailed classification by stocks is available in Annex 1."}

stockPie_fun("Baltic Sea Ecoregion",
             fisheries_guild = c("benthic", "demersal", "pelagic"),
             data_caption = FALSE,
             calculate_status = FALSE,
             active_year = 2017,
             save_plot = FALSE,
             return_plot = TRUE)

```

Plot functions also have a `data_caption` argument that will add the data source to the lower right corner of the margin. If you want to plot the stocks above a certain catch, the `catch_limit` argument can be used. This is particularly useful for ecoregions with many stocks (e.g., Greater North Sea Ecoregion).

```{r kobe_example, echo = TRUE, fig.caption = "Status of Greater North Sea finfish stocks. Left panels: Kobe plots relative to the joint distribution of exploitation (F/FMSY) and stock size (SSB/ MSY Btrigger), by individual stocks. Right panels: Catches/landings of these stocks in 2015. The left panels only include stocks for which MSY reference points have been defined. Stocks in green are exploited below FMSY and the stock size is also above MSY Btrigger. Stocks in red are either exploited above FMSY or the stock size is below MSY Btrigger, or both. Stocks in grey have unknown/undefined status in relation to reference points. For full stock names, see Annex 1. "}

fisheryO::plot_kobe("Greater North Sea Ecoregion", 
                    catch_limit = 10000,
                    guild = "all",
                    active_year = 2016,
                    data_caption = TRUE,
                    return_plot = TRUE,
                    save_plot = FALSE)
```

Plot functions also have a `return_data` argument that will save a .csv of the modified data used for each plot. For now, units and labels can be inferred from the function arguments. `return_data = TRUE` will save a .csv with the same `file_name` and `out_path` as the .png plot.
